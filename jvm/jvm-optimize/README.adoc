===== 堆栈丢失问题
关闭优化 -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow

____
The compiler in the server VM now provides correct stack backtraces for all "cold" built-in exceptions.
For performance purposes, when such an exception is thrown a few times, the method may be recompiled. After recompilation, the compiler may choose a faster tactic using preallocated exceptions that do not provide a stack trace. To disable completely the use of preallocated exceptions, use this new flag: -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow.
